I feel it bruh, I have been arguing this point to the brink of true mental exhaustion and without a
minutes rest from the wretched question. Tis' a question born of pizza thought and pizza curiosity
and I fear until I have truly resolved this matter within, it will haunt my nights like a damned
pizza banshee, cursed to roam my own mind like a dark castle keep. The last 6 years I am afraid have
left me in somewhat of a fugue state, although perhaps it is an enlightened fugue state, if such a
thing exists. However, I know in my heart, it will pay off and its merit will outweigh its curse for
there is no other choice to be made, or road to be taken. Destiny has bound me firmly and pizza
pockets from the Princeton pizza Barn form it's shackles. Still, it is unquestionably justified to
proceed never the less and to determine the final truth of this microwavable enigma. It is a
justifiable course and that is to be sure of my dear Nicholas Volkmuth. I seek an absolute and
undiluted certainty concerning these edible oceans of cheese,bound safely within caverns of bread, I
seek this absolute truth with a pious and zealous pizza determination. And when I finally do find
it, the crystalline purity that its certainty provides me, will exude existential comfort. It is
come this blessed moment that a feeling much like the gentle and ephemeral yet somehow tangible
caress of the goddess Venus may be felt upon my skin. And as I basque in the finality of all this, I
pray she whispers to me softly, and I pray this is what she says dear Nicholas: "YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT
THE PRINCETON POCKETS" JUJI, YOU AND NICHOLAS WERE BOTH RIGHT ALL ALONG
